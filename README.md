# js06-iot

The successor of JS-02. The goal of JS-06 is improved surveillance, sensor integration with integrated user experience compared to JS-02. This code is for an IoT platform, i.e., NVIDIA Jetson, Raspberry Pi, etc.

## Key Features
- Estimate of the concentration of particular matter based on a camera image
- Estimate of visibility based on the extinction ratio of the atmosphere
- Estimate of visibility based on visible targets on a camera image
- Acquisition of weather data from attached sensors.

## Hardware Supports
JS-06 is being developed on the following target platforms.
- [Raspberry PI Model B with 8MB RAM](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/)
